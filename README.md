# PSO-IELM-from-scratch

This code is actually to  use particle swarm optimizer to optimize the performance of IELM algorithm for classification as well as regression.
Here IELM code is also implemented from scratch.

- For classification half moon data is used which is generated in the notebook itself and for regression the csv file is provided in the package.
In classification using PSO, I was able to achieve a testing accuracy of 84.33 with just 10 neurons and in case of regression, a testing rmse of 0.19 was achieved with just
50 neurons.
